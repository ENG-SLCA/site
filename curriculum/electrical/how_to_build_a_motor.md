# Let's Build a Motor!

We'll be applying what we've learned about voltage, current, and magnets to build a simple motor!

## Materials

* 24 - 28 [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge) copper wire
* magnet
* electrical tape
* 9 volt battery
* two paper clips
* wire strippers

## Step 1: Coil

Every motor has some sort of coil. [*Why?*](). *Tightly* coil the copper wire around the battery, wrapping it at least 10 times while retaining 2 inches of wire on each end. Make sure you don't inadvertently touch the wire to the battery terminals!

Carefully slide out the battery and use electrical tape to keep the coil from unraveling itself. You can also wrap each end of the wire around the coil several times to keep the coil from loosening up.

Straighten out the wire ends as much as possible!

## Step 2: Assembly

Using scissors or wire strippers, remove an inch of insulation from both wire ends.

Color the top of the each wire end with a marker.
