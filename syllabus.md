## Mission Statement
SouthLake Christian Academy exists for the sake of God's glory and mission; proclaiming the gospel and discipling the whole person in all aspects of God's reality.

## Description

The AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum is a full year, rigorous, first year college entry-level course that introduces high school students to the foundations of modern computing.

Among this course’s objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in Python as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is **not** a "programming course"; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year's end, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. Students will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers, and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

Whether students elect to take no other computer science courses in their lifetime or consider this class the first step in a longer course of study, it is our sincere hope that they feel more comfortable with — and indeed sometimes skeptical of — the technologies that surround us each day.

## Overview

The course is centered around five **"Big Ideas"**.

* Creative Development [CRD]
* Data [DAT]
* Algorithms and Programming [AAP]
* Computing Systems and Networks [CSN]
* Impact of Computing [IOC]

Further, six **"Computational Thinking Practices"** spiral throughout the "Big Ideas".

* Computational Solution Design [CTP1]
* Algorithms and Program Development [CTP2]
* Abstraction in Program Development [CTP3]
* Code Analysis [CTP4]
* Computing Innovations [CTP5]
* Responsible Computing [CTP6]

## Technology

SouthLake will issue a Macbook device to each student, which we will use daily. Much of the work we do will be in a web environment; it is recommended that students have a current internet browser loaded on their devices (recommended: Mozilla Firefox and/or Google Chrome – both are available for download free of charge.)

## AP Course Assessments

AP courses are _college-level_ courses. Therefore, in an effort to best prepare our students and to reflect the college credit they can potentially earn, policies for these courses will be more in line with collegiate policies and in some instances may differ from honors and college-prep classes at SLCA. Students and parents should carefully review the following policies to ensure a full understanding of the expectations of AP teachers.

Tests may include, but are not limited to, in-class tests, take home tests, major papers or projects, etc.

Quizzes may include, but are not limited to, in-class quizzes, guided reading assignments, vocabulary, etc.

### Numerical Scoring Guide

Students will accrue points as follows:

* Independent Work assignments will be worth 1-10 points each.
* Grades will be worth 11-25 points each.
* Test Grades will be worth 26-100 points each.

### Final Grade

* 80% Semester Grade
* 20% Semester Exam

## Project Work

We will be using various online resources as well as "unplugged" activities.  There will be many online projects assigned that will involve data analysis, manipulating digital information and computer programming projects. These will be assessed as either test or quiz grades depending on the level of effort required.

During the Spring semester, **students are required to take the AP exam** for each AP class in which they are enrolled.  This exam will be administered at SLCA on _TBD_. Students are registered for the exams by SLCA, but are required to pay for each exam taken. The cost is $100 per exam. Students for whom this presents a financial hardship should contact Ms. Julie Swanson. Students who do not take AP exams will have their AP course reclassified as an honors course on their transcript.  AP exams are not factored into the second semester grade because The College Board grades them and scores are not available until July.

Additionally, **AP Computer Science Principles requires the submission of a Create Performance Task (Create PT) along with responses to prompts regarding the task.**  The Create PT is due on _TBD_.  Students will be provided with detailed requirements and instructions for creating and submitting the performance task and related free response questions.  The Create PT accounts for 40% of the final AP score.  The College Board requires that students be given 12 hours of in-class time to complete the task. Students may work on the tasks at home in addition to the time allotted in class. The 2 hour AP exam on _TBD_ will account for 60% of the students’ final AP grade.

## Attendance Policy

* Attendance in class is absolutely essential to the successful completion of the course and to the attainment of a qualified grade on the nation-wide Advance Placement examination held in May. The rigors of this class demand you miss a minimal number of classes.
* If a student is absent on the day a test is administered in class, s/he will have two school days after returning to make up the test. It is the student’s responsibility to make testing arrangements within that timeframe. No test can be made up after the two school days have lapsed.
* If a student is absent on the day an in-class quiz is administered, they will receive a "0" for that quiz. At the end of the semester, the instructor will drop the two lowest in-class quiz grades for each student, meaning a student may miss up to two quizzes in a semester without being penalized for their absence. _NOTE:_ This policy applies only to in-class quizzed and does not apply to assignments that receive credit as a quiz grade. Assignments that were not turned in on time and received a "0" are not available to drop. Assignments missed due to SLCA business may be made up either prior to or within two school days.
* Any assignment (other than an in-class test or quiz) regardless of whether it is counted as a quiz or test grade, must be turned in on the assigned due even if the student is not in class. It is the student’s responsibility to either turn the work in early or see that it is submitted to the teacher (not the front office) on the due date. Assignments not turned in on the assigned due date receive no credit, and there is no opportunity to make up these grades.

## Classroom Expectations

* Assignments are to be completed in a timely manner and in accordance with instructions.
* Participation in class is required.
* The student is expected to take full responsibility for communicating with the teacher concerning absences and excuses and completing make-up work according to SouthLake Christian policy.
* The attitudes of students are to reflect Christ in honesty, humility, and honor.

## Academic Honesty

Students will abide by the honor code statement ***"I shall neither give nor receive help"*** for all assignments unless specifically exempted by the instructor. Violations of the honor code pledge will result in a zero for the assignment; actions will follow the school’s policy on cheating.  The following table is an **inexhaustive** list of reasonable and non-reasonable behaviors:

### Reasonable

* Communicating with classmates about problems in English (or some other spoken language).
* Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
* Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code in class, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
* Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets' origins.
* Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.
* Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Sharing snippets of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems or your own through-course assessments.
* White-boarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
* Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

* Accessing a solution in CS50 Vault to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
* Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.
* Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problems.
* Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
* Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
* Looking at another individual's work during a test or quiz.
* Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
* Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this course in the future.
* Searching for, soliciting, or viewing a test or quiz's questions or answers prior to taking a test or quiz.
* Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.
* Splitting a problem's workload with another individual and combining your work, when prohibited.
* Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
* Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
* Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval.
* Using resources during a test or quiz beyond those explicitly allowed in the test or quiz's instructions.
* Viewing another's solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.

If there is any question that your behavior may be non-reasonable, please come to me for guidance first!
